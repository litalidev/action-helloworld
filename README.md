# action-helloworld
v1.0.0
Demo of using github action
- both linux and windows
- for demo purpose, use a simple helloworld.cpp
- use make (linux) and nmake (windows) to build the executables
- use cl.exe to build is possible (the path already added)
- executables push to source (not a good practice, just for demo purpose)
- executables push to release
- GITHUB_TOKEN needs read and write permissions (project settings)
